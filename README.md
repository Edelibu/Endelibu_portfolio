## Project 1: [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T78_SEf58qL0GvL9RuN2hARDorxqGqwR?usp=sharing)

HR analytics is the process of collecting and analyzing Human Resource (HR) data to improve an organizationâ€™s workforce performance. The process can also be referred to as talent analytics, people analytics, or even workforce analytics. This method of data analysis takes data that is routinely collected by HR and correlates it to HR and organizational objectives.

The data set that I used is a CSV file supplied by Kaggle[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xq-DTUrLn9TgUsH0aOdCyVdhhzKNNOCA/view?usp=sharing], which is created by IBM data scientists. The dataset is trying to determine some of the causes of attrition among employees or what could cause them to leave. The types of data include metrics such as education level, job satisfaction, commute distance, income per month, and other categorical data.

Employees are the backbone of the organization. Organization's performance is heavily based on the quality of the employees. Challenges that an organization has to face due employee attrition are:

     1, Loss of experienced employees
     2, Expense in terms of both money and time to train new employees
     3, Impact on productivity
     4, Impact on Profit

### Brainstorm questions

     1, What factors are contributing more to employee attrition?
     2, What type of measures should the company take in order to retain their
     3, Will the model save lots of money?
     4, Which business unit faces the attrition problem?

In this scenario, I am working as an Analyst at an investment bank. The team that I am working with wants to understand how it should allocate dollarsearmarked for investment into mortgage backed securities. They have asked me to look into the factors that drive home prices.
