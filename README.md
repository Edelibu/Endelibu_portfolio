HR analytics is the process of collecting and analyzing Human Resource (HR) data to improve an organizationâ€™s workforce performance. The process can also be referred to as talent analytics, people analytics, or even workforce analytics. This method of data analysis takes data that is routinely collected by HR and correlates it to HR and organizational objectives.

The data set that I used is a CSV file supplied by Kaggle[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xq-DTUrLn9TgUsH0aOdCyVdhhzKNNOCA/view?usp=sharing], which is created by IBM data scientists. The dataset is trying to determine some of the causes of attrition among employees or what could cause them to leave. The types of data include metrics such as education level, job satisfaction, commute distance, income per month, and other categorical data.
